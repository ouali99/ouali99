👋 Hi, I’m @ouali99
👀 I’m interested in web and mobile development, with a focus on microservices architecture, cloud deployment, and mobile apps.
🌱 I’m currently learning web development with microservices, deployment on Azure and AWS, and working on a project called UberTaxi, which simulates the Uber app using Flutter.
💼 I’m actively looking for an internship in web or mobile development, where I can apply my skills in front-end, back-end, and cloud technologies.
💞️ I’m eager to collaborate on innovative projects and to contribute to a dynamic development team.
